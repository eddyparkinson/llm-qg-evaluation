      "What is Problem Solving?\n",
      "•“Finding a solution to a difficult or complex question or situation; to engage in the actions or thoughts necessary to discover solutions to problems.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Types of Problems\n",
      "•There are lots of different types of problems we can solve -and the difficulty of each problem can change dramatically. For example, let's try solving some of these problems…\n",
      "If I have $50 and purchase 3 boxes of chocolates on sale for $9 each, how much change will I receive?\n",
      "How can we reverse climate change?\n",
      "How can we ensure we get good results for all the courses we are studying?\n",
      "\n",
      "Routine and Non-Routing Problems\n",
      "•Routine (simple)problems are the kinds of problems have simple solutions and that occur regularly.\n",
      "•Non-Routine(complicated &complex)problems are more difficult and often require devisingstrategies to solve.\n",
      "•Then there are wicked problems…\n",
      "\n",
      "Characteristics of Wicked Problems\n",
      "•Difficult to define.\n",
      "•Have many interdependencies and are often multi-causal.\n",
      "•Resolution attempts often result in unforeseen consequences.\n",
      "•Often not stable.\n",
      "•No clear solution.\n",
      "•Socially complex.\n",
      "•Responsibility of multiple domains.\n",
      "•(Some) characterized by chronic policy failure.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Importance of Problem Solving\n",
      "“Regardless of profession or title, at some level we are all hired to do the same job. We are all problem solvers, paid to anticipate, identify, prevent, and solve problems within our areas of expertise.\n",
      "This applies to any job, at any level, in any organization, anywhere in the world, and being aware of this is absolutely vital to job search and career success in any field.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Six-Step Problem Solving Process\n",
      "•There are many different problem-solving methods, and the six-step method is just one of them.\n",
      "•The problem for most people is that they do not use one process to solve problems and issues or to make decisions.\n",
      "•Another problem is that people are not consistent in how they solve problem. They do not find something that works and then do it the same way over and over to be successful.\n",
      "•The Six-Step Problem-Solving Process is as follows:\n",
      "1.Identify the problem,\n",
      "2.Analyse the problem,\n",
      "3.Generate potential solutions,\n",
      "4.Select and plan a solution,\n",
      "5.Implement the solution,\n",
      "6.Evaluate the solution\n",
      "Problem Solving Strategies and Techniques\n",
      "•Some of the most commonly used problem solving strategies include:\n",
      "•Trial and error,\n",
      "•Using some form of algorithmto reach a solution, and\n",
      "•Using some form of heuristicto reach a solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Programming Domains\n",
      "•When we write computer programs to solve problems, these problems can be in a wide variety of different areas, from controlling nuclear power plants to providing video games for mobile devices.\n",
      "•However, it makes sense for us to break up software into a few broad categories, broadly speaking these are:\n",
      "•Scientific Applications,\n",
      "•Business Applications,\n",
      "•Artificial Intelligence,\n",
      "•Systems Programming, and\n",
      "•Web Software.\n",
      "\n",
      "Programming Language Categories\n",
      "•And just like there are categories of applications, there are categories of programming languages which may be suited to writing applications in these different domains. For example:\n",
      "•Imperative programminglanguages:\n",
      "•Imperative languages include procedurallanguages (Pascal, C etc.), object orientedlanguages (Java, C++ etc.) and scriptinglanguages (Python, Perl, JavaScript etc.)\n",
      "•These are the most commonly used type of programming language and are what we'll be focussing on in this course.\n",
      "•Functional programminglanguages:\n",
      "•These are languages which operate mainly on mathematical functions, so you define a function, provide it with input, and receive the output.\n",
      "•These tend to be used more for scientific / mathematical applications.\n",
      "•Logic programming languages:\n",
      "•These are rule based languages, where the specific order of execution is not specified, and the language must choose the order in which the rules are applied to produce the desired outcome of the program.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note: We do not consider Mark-up Languages (HTML, XML etc.)to be programming languages, because you cannot perform calculations with them -like they sound, they are for 'mark-up' (i.e. 'tagging') of data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Software Development Methodologies\n",
      "•Largely regardless of programming domain or language, we tend to use one of a handful of techniques to successfully design software that functions as expected.\n",
      "•The most commonly used development methodologies are:\n",
      "•The Waterfall model,\n",
      "•Agile development, and\n",
      "•Scrum.\n",
      "•We'll take a brief look at the main characteristic of each methodology over the next few slides, and then we can have a chat about which one we think is the best method and why that might be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Topic 2: Introduction to Python, Operators and Data Types\n",
      "What Type of Programming Language is Python?\n",
      "•Python is an imperative, general purpose language which we can write pretty much any type of application in.\n",
      "•Business apps, games, scientific, web, data analytics, artificial intelligence… The list goes on. We can write them all in Python if we wanted to due to the language’s rich set of features.\n",
      "•However -that doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s the BEST language to write an app in any given field…\n",
      "•…but it IS a very useful all-rounder, with a clean, attractive syntax that makes it easy to learn and use.\n",
      "\n",
      "Executing Programs\n",
      "•There are three different ways in which we can convert a program in a high-level language like Python into a version that can be executed on a CPU:\n",
      "•Compilation\n",
      "•All program code is converted into machine code before the program executes. Once a program has been compiled into machine code it is ready to be executed -this typically means that the code can execute very quickly.\n",
      "•Pure Interpretation\n",
      "•Each line of program code is converted into machine code for execution (one line at a time) as the program executes. This typically means that the code executes less quickly than compilation.\n",
      "•https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/\n",
      "•Hybrid Implementation\n",
      "•In hybrid implementation, the program code is translated into an intermediate programming language which is designed to be able to be interpreted quickly before the program executes. Once this has been done, it is this intermediate codethat is actually interpreted into machine code. This typically results in code that executes relatively quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note: So the execution speed hierarchy from fastest to slowest is: Compilation, then Hybrid Interpretation, then Pure Interpretation.\n",
      "First program in Python\n",
      "•The first program any programmer should write in any programming language (even one they know the language well and have just installed the development tools) is called HelloWorld.\n",
      "•As you know, it prints the text “Hello, World!” to the screen.\n",
      "•The reason we should write this program first is two-fold:\n",
      "1.It’s probably the simplest program we can possible write, and\n",
      "2.When it works, it proves that our development environment has been installed and set up correctly.\n",
      "•In Python, the ‘hello world’ program is simply this:\n",
      "print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
      "•When we run the program, it prints the message.\n",
      "\n",
      "Data Types\n",
      "•A variable in any programming language is a named piece of computer memory, containing some information inside.\n",
      "•Variables usually are of a certain type, which define their representation, size and the operations allowed.\n",
      "•Python is a strongly typed language, which means that variables do have a type and that the type matters when performing operations on a variable.\n",
      "•Python is also a dynamically typed language, which means that the type of the variable is determined only during runtime. In fact, as you will see shortly, you can change a variable’s type at runtime (dynamically) by assigning a new value.\n",
      "Basic Data Types: bool\n",
      "•bool type (Boolean data type) is a data type that has one of two possible values(usually denoted True and False) which is intended to represent the two truth values of logic.\n",
      "•If we enter: type(True) or type(False)into the Python shell it responds:\n",
      "<class 'bool’>\n",
      "•We will be using these values mostly in branching and looping constructs.\n",
      "Basic Data Types: int\n",
      "•int data (short for integer) is just a whole number without any fractions or decimal places or anything like that.\n",
      "•If we enter: type(1) or type(-5) into the Python shell it responds:\n",
      "<class 'int'>\n",
      "•Floats can generally hold any value which can be represented as an int, but vice-versa you would lose the fractional part. I.e. we can decide to convert the int value 123into a float 123.0 without losing any data, but we can't convert the float value 123.4into an int without losing the .4 part.\n",
      "•If we enter: type(1.23) into the Python shell it responds:\n",
      "<class 'float'>\n",
      "Note: A widening conversion, say from intto float is nearly always safe (no data lost), while a narrowing conversion, such as from float to intis typically NOT safe.\n",
      "Basic Data Types: str\n",
      "•Strings are containers for characters. The actual name of the string type in Python is str.\n",
      "•Strings can be of any length up to the available RAM you have available on your system, so if you really wanted to store several copies of the book \"War and Peace\" in a single string, you could.\n",
      "•If we enter: type(\"I bet this is a string\") into the Python shell it responds:\n",
      "<class 'str'>\n",
      "Basic Data Types: str(Cont'd)\n",
      "•When we specify str data, we must enclose it in some kind of quotes so the interpreter knows to treat it as string.\n",
      "•We can use quotation marks: \"like this\"\n",
      "•Or we can use single quotes: 'like this'\n",
      "•Or we can use three-sets of quotation marks: \n",
      "\"\"\"like this\"\"\" or '''like this'''\n",
      "•If we want to actually use quotes in our data, for example:\n",
      "\"I'm putting this in \"quotes\" because I can.\"\n",
      "•Then we can either do what's called escaping the quotes we want to include in our data by placing a blackslash( \\) before them, so our example becomes:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm putting this in \\\"quotes\\\" because I can.\"\n",
      "Single quote in I'm\n",
      "Backslashes directly before any quotation mark we want included\n",
      "Basic Data Types: str(Cont'd)\n",
      "•If we decide to enclose our string in a set of three quotation marks, then the formatting of our string is preserved across multiple lines and we don't need to escape any 'or \"characters. For example:\n",
      "\"\"\"I'm putting this in \"quotes\"\n",
      "because I can.\"\"\"\n",
      "Basic Data Types: str(Cont'd)\n",
      "•The reason it's important to put string data in quotation marks of some kind is so that the interpreter knows how to deal with the data.\n",
      "•For example if we enter the following into the Python command line we get a valid result:\n",
      ">>> 2.2 + 3.3\n",
      "5.5\n",
      "•But how about if you enter the following?\n",
      ">>> 2.2 + \"Bob\"\n",
      "•What do you think will happen?\n",
      "Basic Data Types: str(Cont'd)\n",
      "•What we get it this:\n",
      ">>> 2.2 + \"Bob\"\n",
      "Traceback(most recent call last):\n",
      "File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n",
      "TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'float' and 'str'\n",
      "•Which basically means that Python doesn't know how to use the + (plus) operator with a floatand a str.\n",
      "•Okay, so now let's see if you can guess what happens when you enter this:\n",
      "\n",
      ">>> \"2.2\" + \"Bob\"\n",
      "Standard Mathematical Operators\n",
      "•Now we know about some of the most common types of data we might want to work with, it's time to move on to some of the operators than help us perform calculations.\n",
      "•If you've programmed in any language before then you'll already be familiar with many of them, although there are some Python-specific operators, too.\n",
      "•The standard \"big four\" operators are:\n",
      "Operator Symbol\tOperator Name\tExample\n",
      "+\tPlus\t10 + 2 equals 12\n",
      "-\tMinus\t10 -2 equals 8\n",
      "*\tMultiply\t10 * 2 equals 20\n",
      "/\tDivide\t10 / 2 equals 5.0\n",
      "\n",
      "Operator Precedence\n",
      "•The order in which operators are applied to data is really important, and there's a simple rule that governs which \"value-pairs\" in a calculation get calculated before others.\n",
      "•For example, what's the result of the following calculation?\n",
      "2 + 10 * 5 = ?\n",
      "•Clue: BODMAS\n",
      "•BODMAS acronym: B –Brackets, O –Order of powers or roots, D –Division, M –MultiplicationA –Addition, and S –Subtraction.\n",
      "•First, we solve brackets, then powers or roots, then division or multiplication (whichever comes first from the left side of the expression), and then finally, subtraction or addition, whichever comes on the left side.\n",
      "Working With Variables\n",
      "•A variable should be understood as a named container for a piece of data.\n",
      "•For example, to define (i.e. create) a variable called luckyNumberwhich stores the number 6 we could use the command:\n",
      "\n",
      "luckyNumber= 6\n",
      "•Weknow that 6 is an int-but how does Python know that you're storing an integer? It looks at the right-hand side of the expression (the value) and determines the type of data automatically.\n",
      "•If we now enter: type(luckyNumber), it says:\n",
      "<class 'int'>\n",
      "Working With Variables (Cont'd)\n",
      "•Now if we want to change the value of the luckyNumbervariable, we can simply give it a new value by issuing a statement such as:\n",
      "luckyNumber= 16\n",
      "•And to display the number we can use the print()function like this:\n",
      "print(luckyNumber)\n",
      "•Which will give the following output:\n",
      ">>> print(luckyNumber)\n",
      "16\n",
      "•The original value of luckyNumberwill be lost(is overwritten).\n",
      "Working With Multiple Variables\n",
      "•Let's say we create two variables like this:\n",
      "firstNum= 3\n",
      "secondNum= 4\n",
      "•Now we can add them up and print out the sum like this:\n",
      "print(firstNum+ secondNum)\n",
      "•In the above scenario we'll get 7\n",
      "•What if we said: print(firstNum-secondNum)?\n",
      "•What about: print(firstNum* secondNum)?\n",
      "•Now what happens when we use the divideoperator?\n",
      "Working With Multiple Variables (Cont'd)\n",
      "•In Python 3, when we divide one int(eger) by another int-the result WILL ALWAYS BE A FLOAT!\n",
      "•This is NOT THE SAME AS MOST LANGUAGES!\n",
      "•Python 3 changes the result of ANY division to a float.\n",
      "•Let's take a look at an example…\n",
      "UNUSUAL!\n",
      "Working With Multiple Variables (Cont'd)\n",
      "•Try this:\n",
      "first = 2\n",
      "second = 4\n",
      "result = first / second\n",
      "print(result) \n",
      "type(result) \n",
      "•Then this:\n",
      "first = 2\n",
      "second = 4 \n",
      "result = second / first\n",
      "print(result)\n",
      "type (result)\n",
      "•In summary -all standard division results in a value that is a float, even if the value involved are integers. In most languages the integer value 2 divided by the integer value 4 would be 0, and 4 divided by 2 would be 2 (NOT2.0)!\n",
      "2 / 4 = 0.5\n",
      "<class 'float'>\n",
      "4 / 2 = 2.0\n",
      "<class 'float'>\n",
      "While normal for Python, this is not normal in most languages\n",
      "Working With Multiple Variables (Cont'd)\n",
      "•But… we can use an integer division operator instead for division to act as we might expect in to -which in Python 3 is the double-slash:\n",
      "first = 3\n",
      "second = 4\n",
      "result = first // second\n",
      "print(result) \n",
      "type(result) \n",
      "3 // 4 = 0\n",
      "<class 'int'>\n",
      "While used in Python, this operator doesn't even exist in most languages\n",
      "30 // 5 = 6\n",
      "<class 'int'>\n",
      "Working With Multiple Variables\n",
      "•We can change the type of our variable whenever we choose.\n",
      "•This makes the Python language very flexible, but if we're not careful it can lead to errors-for example, the following sequence of statements is legal:\n",
      "luckyNumber= 6\n",
      "luckyNumber= 6.0\n",
      "luckyNumber= \"six\"\n",
      "luckyNumber= \"elephants\"\n",
      "•But what happens if we divided a value by our luckyNumber variable after this sequence of statements?\n",
      "•Nothing great -because you can't divide a value by a string. So in this instance, we'd need to either keep track of the typeof our luckyNumber variable, or wrap its usage in exception handling code to make it safer to use (more on which later in this course).\n",
      "The inputFunction\n",
      "•When we want to get console input from the user, we use the input method.\n",
      "•We typically assign the result of running the input method to a variable as we just saw when we wrote:\n",
      "\n",
      "name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n",
      "print(\"Hello, \" + name + \"!\")\n",
      "•When using the input function, the typeof the data returned is always a string.\n",
      "•This will cause us problems if we did something like this:\n",
      "number = input(\"Please enter a number between 1 and 10: \")\n",
      "sum = number + 5\n",
      "print(\"Adding 5 to that gives: \" + sum)\n",
      "The reason we're going to have a problem is because we're getting some data\n",
      "and assigning it to a variable called number\n",
      "•…and then we're trying to add together that number variable and an integer\n",
      "but the input function converts whatever data is entered into a string.\n",
      "And as we saw previously we can't add an int and a string together.\n",
      "The input Function (Cont'd)\n",
      "•So how do we get around this problem?\n",
      "•We have to convert the entered data into the type we want it to be!\n",
      "•For example:\n",
      "number = input(\"Please enter a number between 1 and 10: \")\n",
      "sum = int(number)+ 5\n",

      "first = file.readline()\n",
      "second = file.readline()\n",
